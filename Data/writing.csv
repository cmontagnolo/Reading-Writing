Thinking about your interests and motivations is a key stage in your career exploration. It can help you to formulate ideas about different job roles that could suit you and the sectors or organisations that you might like to work in.

For example, it can be helpful to think about:

your personality - what are you like as an individual? what types of roles or workplaces would suit you?
your abilities and skills - what are you good at? what skills have you developed throughout your life so far?
your interests - what do you enjoy doing? what kind of careers appeal to you?
your values - what do you care about? what is important to you?
You can use online questionnaires and personality tests to help you explore these aspects of yourself. Once you have an idea of your interests and motivations, you can use this learning to start building your own career profile
